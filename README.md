# ansible-cloud\_utils
Ansible Collection for performing operations against public and private "clouds".

## Building this Collection
```
pushd redhatofficial/cloud_utils/
ansible-galaxy collection build
popd
```


## Using this Collection

Information about using collections can be found here:
- https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/collections_using.html

The roles in this collection are in the `redhatofficial.cloud_utils` namespace.

They can be used by adding the collection to the playbook:

```
---
- hosts: all
  collections:
    - redhatofficial.cloud_utils
```

## Roles
Roles provided by this project.
Examples of how to use these roles are included in the top-level `playbooks` directory

### enable\_chrony
Enables `chrony` and disables `ntp`.

### idm\_register\_ipa\_client
Registers an IPA client with an IdM or IPA server.

#### Options
| parameter             | requried | default | comments
|-----------------------|----------|---------|---------
| idm\_server           | yes      |         | The IdM/IPA server to regsiter the IPA client with
| idm\_domain           | yes      |         | The IdM/IPA domain to register the IPA client with
| idm\_enroll\_user     | yes      |         | The IdM/IPA user to enroll the IPA client with
| idm\_enroll\_password | yes      |         | The IdM/IPA password to enroll the IPA client with
| idm\_register\_force  | no       | False   | If `true` and IPA client is already registered it will be unregistered.

#### Notes
* Does not configure NTP

### configure\_vm\_network\_and\_ip
Configures the virtualization provider network and IP for given hosts. This is useful if need migrate a VM from one vlan/subnet to another vlan/subnet by updating both the virtualization provider and destination host.

The concept is that this playbook is cloud provider agnostic and can figure out how to move a VM from one network to another on any cloud provider, staying on that same provider, based on gathering facts about the VM. Though currently it has only been tested and written for a couple providers, as need arises for more providers the playbook can be easly extended to handle more.

#### Tested With
* Red Hat Virtualization
  * 4.0.5
* VMware vCenter
  * 5.1.0

#### Assumptions
* Only handles one network interface
* Assumes migrating the first network interface
* target host facts are gathered so that `ansible_virtualization_type` is set
* `ansible_virtualization_type` in ['RHEV', 'VMware']

### optimize\_kernel\_scheduler
[What is the suggested I/O scheduler to improve disk performance when using Red Hat Enterprise Linux with virtualization?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5427).  The following playbook configures noop for the IO queue scheduler kernel parameter for RHEL VMs on VMware infrastructure per [How to use the Noop IO Scheduler](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/109223).

#### Notes
* A backup of the grub configuration is made when changed.
* This playbook does not perform the required reboot to enable this paramater.
